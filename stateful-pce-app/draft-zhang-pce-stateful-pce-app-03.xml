	<t>
	A Stateful PCE maintains information about LSP characteristics and resource usage 
	within the network in order to provide traffic engineering calculations for its associated PCCs.  
This document describes general considerations for stateful PCEP and examines its applicability 
and benefits through a number of use cases. PCEP extensions required for stateful PCE usage 
are covered in separate documents.

   <section title="Introduction">
      <t><xref target="RFC5440"/> describes the Path Computation Element
      Protocol (PCEP).  PCEP defines the communication between a Path Computation
      Client (PCC) and a Path Control Element (PCE), or between PCE and PCE,
      enabling computation of Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) for Traffic
      Engineering Label Switched Path (TE LSP) characteristics. Extensions for 
	  support of GMPLS in PCEP are defined in 
	  <xref target='I-D.ietf-pce-gmpls-pcep-extensions'></xref>. </t>
	  
	  <t> 
	  As per <xref target="RFC4655"/>, a PCE can be either stateful or stateless. Compared to a 
	  stateless PCE, a stateful PCE has access to not only the network states, 
	  but also to the set of active paths and their reserved resources in use in the 
	  network. In other words, the state in a stateful PCE is determined not only 
	  by the TED but also by the set of active LSPs and their corresponding reserved 
	  resources. Furthermore, a stateful PCE might also retain the information of LSPs
	  under construction in order to reduce resource contention. Such augmented state
	  allows the PCE to compute constrained paths while considering individual LSPs 
	  and their interaction.
	  </t>
	  
	  <t> This document describes describes how stateful PCE can solve various problems
	  for MPLS-TE and GMPLS deployment use cases, and the benefits it brings to such 
	  deployments.

	  specifies a set of extensions to PCEP to enable stateful
      control of tunnels between and across PCEP sessions in compliance with
      <xref target="RFC4657"/>.  It includes mechanisms to effect tunnel state
      synchronization between PCCs and PCEs, delegation of control over tunnels to

      and across PCEP sessions.</t>
	  
	  <t><xref target='I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce'></xref> applies equally
	  to MPlS-TE and GMPLS LSPs. </t> 
	  
	  <t>Several new functions were added in PCEP to support stateful
		  PCEs and are described in <xref target='I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce'></xref>.
		  A function can be initiated either from a PCC towards a PCE (C-E) or
		  from a PCE towards a PCC (E-C). The new functions are:

		  <list style="hanging">
			<t hangText="Capability negotiation (E-C,C-E):"> both the PCC and the
			PCE must announce during PCEP session establishment that they support
			PCEP Stateful PCE extensions.</t>

			<t hangText="LSP state synchronization (C-E):"> after the session
			between the PCC and a stateful PCE is initialized, the PCE must learn
			the state of a PCC's LSPs before it can perform path computations or
			update LSP attributes in a PCC.</t>

			<t hangText="LSP Update Request (E-C):"> A PCE requests modification of

			<t hangText="LSP control delegation (C-E,E-C):"> a PCC grants to a PCE
			the right to update LSP attributes on one or more LSPs; the PCE becomes
			the authoritative source of the LSP's attributes as long as the

		 <section anchor="LSP-DB-sync" title="LSP State Synchronization">
			<t>A stateful PCE maintains two databases for path computation. The first database is the 
			Traffic Engineering Database (TED) which includes the topology and resource state in the 
			network. This information can be obtained by a stateful PCE using the same mechanisms 
			as a steateless PCE (see <xref target="RFC4655"/>. The second database is the 
			LSP state Database (LSP-DB), in which a PCE stores attributes of all active LSPs in 
			the network, such as their path through the network, bandwidth/resource usage,
			switching types, and LSP contraints etc. The stateful PCE extensions support population of 
			this database using information received from the network nodes via LSP Report messages. 
			Population of the LSP database via other means is not precluded.

		 <section anchor="PCE-survivability" title="PCE Survivability">
			 <t> For a stateful PCE, an important issue is to get the LSP state information resynchronized
			 after a restart. <xref target='I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce'></xref> includes support of a 
			 synchronization function, allowing the PCC to synchronize its LSP state with the PCE. This can be 
			 applied equally to an LER client or another PCE, allowing for support of multiple ways of re-aquiring 
			 the LSP database on a restart. For example, the state can be retrieved from the network nodes,
			 or from another stateful PCE. Because synchronization may also be skipped, if a PCE 
			 implementation has 
			 the means to retrieve its database in a different way (for example from a backup copy stored locally), 
			 the state can be restored without further overhead in the network.

	    <t> Because LSP attribute changes in <xref target="RFC5440"/> are
	    driven by PCReq messages under control of a PCC's local timers, the
	    sequence of RSVP reservation arrivals occurring in the network will
	    be randomized. This, coupled with a lack of global LSP state
	    visibility on the part of a stateless PCE may result in suboptimal

	    example in which throughput is at 50% of optimal as a result of lack
	    of visibility and synchronized control across PCC's. In this
	    scenario, the decision must be made as to whether to route any

	    <t>Most existing RSVP-TE implementations will not tear down
	    established LSPs in the event of the failure of the bandwidth
	    increase procedure detailed in <xref target="RFC3209"/>. This
	    behavior is directly implied to be correct in <xref
	    target="RFC3209"/> and is often desirable from an operator's
	    perspective, because either a) the destination prefixes are not
	    reachable via any means other than MPLS or b) this would result in
	    significant packet loss as demand is shifted to other LSPs in the
	    overlay mesh.</t>

	    <t>In addition, there are currently few implementations offering
	    ingress admission control at the LSP level. Again, having ingress
	    admission control on a per LSP basis is not necessarily desirable
	    from an operational perspective, as a) one must over-provision
	    tunnels significantly in order to avoid deleterious effects
	    resulting from stacked transport and flow control systems and b)
	    there is currently no efficient commonly available northbound
	    interface for dynamic configuration of per LSP ingress admission
	    control (such an interface could easily be defined using the
	    extensions present in this spec, but it beyond the scope of the
	    current document).</t>

	    <t>Lack of ingress admission control coupled with the behavior in
	    <xref target="RFC3209"/> effectively results in mis-signaled LSPs
	    during periods of contention for network capacity between LSPs in a
	    given LSP priority. This in turn causes information loss in the TED
	    with regard to actual network state, resulting in LSPs sharing
	    common network interfaces with mis-signaled LSPs operating in a
	    degraded state for significant periods of time, even when unused
	    network capacity may potentially be available.</t>

	    <t>Reference Topology 1 in <xref target="Reference-topology-1"/> and
	    Tables <xref target="Deadlock-link-parameters" format="counter"/>
	    and <xref target="Deadlock-demand" format="counter"/> show a use
	    case that demonstrates this behavior. Two LSPs, LSP 1 and LSP 2 are
	    signaled with demand 2 and routed along paths A-C-D-E and B-C-D-E
	    respectively. At a later time, the demand of LSP 1 increases to
	    20. Under such a demand, the LSP cannot be resignaled. However, the
	    existing LSP will not be torn down. In the absence of ingress
	    policing, traffic on LSP 1 will cause degradation for traffic of LSP
	    2 (due to oversubscription on the links C-D and D-E), as well as
	    information loss in the TED with regard to the actual network
	    state.</t>

	    <t>The problem could be easily ameliorated by global visibility of
	    LSP state coupled with PCC- external demand measurements and
	    placement of two LSPs on disjoint links. Note that while the demand
	    of 20 for LSP 1 could never be satisfied in the given topology, what
	    could be achieved would be isolation from the ill-effects of the
	    (unsatisfiable) increased demand.</t>

		For protection purposes, a PCC may send a request to a PCE for computing a set of paths for a

		<section anchor="restoration" title="Restoration">
		<t>
		In case of a link failure, such as fiber cut, multiple LSPs may fail at the same time. Thus, 
		the source nodes of the affected LSPs will be informed of the failure by the nodes detecting the 
		failure. These source nodes will send requests to a PCE for rerouting. In order to reuse the 
		resource taken by an existing LSP, the source node can send a PCReq message including the 
		XRO object with F bit set, together with RRO object, as specified in <xref target="RFC5521"/>.
		</t>
		
		<t>
		If a stateless PCE is exploited, it might respond to the rerouting requests separately if they 
		arrive at different times. Thus, it might result in sub-optimal resource usage. Even worse, 
		it might unnecessarily block some of the rerouting requests due to insufficient resources for 
		later-arrived rerouting messages. If a stateful PCE is used to fulfill this task, it can 
		re-compute the affected LSPs concurrently while reusing part of the existing LSPs resources 
		when it is informed of the failed link identifier provided by the first request. This is made 
		possible since the stateful PCE can check what other LSPs are affected by the failed link and 
		their route information by inspecting its LSP-DB. As a result, a better performance, such as 
		better resource usage, minimal probability of blocking upcoming new rerouting requests sent 
		as a result of the link failure, can be achieved. 
		</t>
		
		<t>
		In order to further reduce the amount of LSP rerouting messages flow in the network, the 
		notification can be performed at the node(s) which detect the link failure. For example, 
		suppose there are two LSPs in the network as shown in Figure <xref
	        target="Reference-topology-3" format="counter"/>: (i) LSP1: N1->N5->N4->N3; 
		(ii) LSP2:  N2->N5->N4. They traverse the failed link between N5-N4. When N4 detects the failure, 
		it can send a notification message to a stateful PCE. Note that the stateful PCE stores the 
		path information of the LSPs that are affected by the link failure, so it does not need 
		to acquire this information from N4. Moreover, it can make use of the bandwidth resources occupied by the affected LSPs when performing path recalculation. After N4 receives the new paths from the PCE, it notifies the ingress nodes of the LSPs, i.e., N1 and N2, 
		and specifies the new paths which should be used as the rerouting paths. To support this, it would require extensions to existing signaling protocol.
		</t>
		
		<t>
		Alternatively, if the target is to avoid resource contention within the time-window of high LSP 
		requests, a stateful PCE can retain the under-construction LSP resource usage information for 
		a given time and exclude it from being used for forthcoming LSPs request. In this way, 
		it can ensure that the resource will not be double-booked and thus the issue of resource 
		contention and computation crank-backs can be resolved. 
		</t>

		<section anchor="srlg-diversity" title="SRLG Diversity">
		<t>
		An alternative way to achieve efficient recovery is to maintain SRLG disjointness between LSPs. 
		This can be achieved at provisioning time, if the routes of all the LSPs are requested together, 
		using a synchronized computation of the different LSPs with SRLG disjointness constraint. If the LSPs 
		need to be provisioned at different times (more general, the routes are requested at different times, 
		e.g. in the case of a restoration), the PCC can specify, as constraints to the path computation a set 
		of Shared Risk Link Groups (SRLGs) using the Explicit route Object 
		<xref target="RFC5521"/>. However, for the latter to be effective, it is needed that the entity 
		that requests the route to the PCE maintains updated SRLG information of all the LSPs to which 
		it must maintain the disjointness.
		</t>
		<t>
		Using a stateful PCE allows the maintenance of the updated SRLG information of the established LSPs in a centralized manner. Having such information in the PCE facilitates the PCC to specify, as constraint to the path computation, the SRLG disjointess of a set of already established LSPs by only providing the LSP identifiers.

	<section anchor="VNT" title="Maintenance of Virtual Network Topology (VNT)">
	<t> 
	In Multi-Layer Networks (MLN), a Virtual Network Topology (VNT) 
	<xref target="RFC5212"/> consists of a set of one or more TE LSPs in the lower layer which provides TE links to the upper layer. In 
	<xref target="RFC5623"/>, the PCE-based architecture is proposed to support path computation in MLN networks in order to achieve inter-layer TE. 
	</t>
	
	<t>
	The establishment/teardown of a TE link in VNT needs to take into consideration the state of existing LSPs and/or new LSP request(s) in the higher layer. As specified in 
	<xref target="RFC5623"/>, a VNT manager (VNTM) is in charge of the topology in the upper layer by connections in the lower layer. Hence, when a stateless PCE is requested to compute a new TE link, it will need interaction with VNTM for detailed TE link information. To be more specific, without detailed LSP
information, this process would be inefficient or even infeasible for stateless PCE(s), unless with cooperation with VNTM. On the other hand, a stateful PCE seems more suitable to make the decision of when and how to modify the VNT either to accommodate new LSP requests or to re-optimize resource use across layers irrespective of PCE models. As described in Section 2.2, path computation for a VNT change can be performed by the PCE if a single PCE model is adopted. On the other hand, if a per-layer PCE model is more appropriate, coordination between PCEs is required.

	<section anchor="Reoptimization" title="LSP Re-optimization">
	
	 <t>
          In order to make efficient usage of network resource,
          re-optimization of one or more LSPs dynamically through
          online planning is desirable.
          In case of a stateless PCE, in order to optimize network
          resource usage dynamically through online planning,  PCC
          (e.g., NMS) should send a request to PCE together with
          detailed path/bandwidth information of the LSPs that need to
          be concurrently optimized. This would require a PCC (e.g.,
          NMS) to determine when and which LSPs should be
          optimized. Given all of the existing LSP state information
          kept at a stateful PCE, it allows automation of this process
          without the PCC (e.g. NMS) to supply give the
          re-optimization commands and the existing LSP state
          information. Moreover, since a stateful PCE can maintain the
          information regarding to all LSPs that are currently under
          signaling, it makes the optimization procedures be performed
          more intelligently and effectively. 

        </t>
        <t>
          A special case of LSP re-optimization is Global Concurrent Optimization (GCO) <xref target="RFC5557" />. 
          Global control of LSP operation sequence in <xref
          target="RFC5557" /> is predicated   on the use of what is
          effectively a stateful (or semi-stateful) NMS. The NMS can
          be either not local to the switch, in which case another
          northbound interface is required for LSP attribute changes,
          or local/collocated, in which case there are significant
          issues with efficiency in resource usage. 

          Stateful PCE adds a few features that:
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>  Roll the NMS visibility into the PCE and remove the requirement for an additional northbound interface</t>
            <t> Allow the PCE to determine when re-optimization is needed, with which level (GCO or a more incremental optimization) </t>
	    <t>Allow the PCE to determine which LSPs should be re-optimized</t>
            <t> Allow a PCE to control the sequence of events across multiple      PCCs, allowing for bulk (and truly global) optimization, LSP      shuffling etc.</t>

	<section anchor="flex-grid" title="Resource defragmentation">
		<t>
		In networks with link bundles, if LSPs are dynamically allocated and released over time, 
		the resource becomes fragmented. The overall available resource on a (bundle) link might 
		be sufficient for a new LSP request. But if the available resource is not continuous, 
		the request would be rejected. In order to perform the defragmentation procedure, 
		stateful PCEs cam be used, since existing TE LSPs information is required to accurately 
		assess spectrum resources on the LSPs, and perform de-fragmentation while ensuring a minimal 
		disruption of the network, e.g., based on active LSP priorities .
		</t>
		<t>
		A case of particular interest to GMPLS-based transport networks is the frequency 
		defragmentation in flexible grid. In Flexible grid networks <xref target="I-D.ogrcetal-ccamp-flexi-grid-fwk"/>, LSPs with 
		different slot widths (such as 12.5G, 25G etc.) can co-exist so as to accommodate the 
		services with different bandwidth requests. Therefore, even if the overall spectrum can 
		meet the service request, it may not be usable if they are not contiguous. Thus, with the 
		help of existing LSP state information, stateful PCE can make the resource grouped 
		together to be usable. Moreover, stateful PCE can proactively choose routes for upcoming 
		path requests to reduce the chance of spectrum defragmentation.

	<section anchor="Impairment" title="Impairment-Aware Routing and Wavelength Assignment (IA-RWA)">
		<t>In WSON networks <xref target="RFC6163"/>, a wavelength-switched LSP traverses one or more fiber links. 
		The bit rates of the client signals carried by the wavelength LSPs may be the same or different.
		Hence, a fiber link may transmit a number of wavelength LSPs with equal or mixed bit rate signals.
		For example, a fiber link may multiplex the wavelengths with only 10G signals, mixed 10G and 
		40G signals, or mixed 40G and 100G signals. </t>
		
		<t> IA-RWA in WSONs refers to the RWA process (i.e., lightpath computation) that takes 
		into account the optical layer/transmission imperfections by considering as additional 
		(i.e., physical layer) constraints. To be more specific, linear and non-linear effects 
		associated with the optical network elements should be incorporated into the route and 
		wavelength assignment procedure. For example, the physical imperfection can result in 
		the interference of two adjacent lightpaths. Thus, a guard band should be reserved between 
		them to alleviate these effects. The width of the guard band between two adjacent wavelengths 
		depends on their characteristics, such as modulation formats and bit rates. Two adjacent 
		wavelengths with different characteristics (e.g., different bit rates) may need a wider guard 
		band and with same characteristics may need a narrower guard band. For example, 
		50GHz spacing may be acceptable for two adjacent wavelengths with 40G signals. But for 
		two adjacent wavelengths with different bit rates (e.g., 10G and 40G), a larger spacing 
		such as 300GHz spacing may be needed. Hence, the characteristics (states) of the existing 
		wavelength LSPs should be considered for a new RWA request in WSON. </t>
		
		<t> In summary, when stateful PCEs are used to perform the IA-RWA procedure, they need to 
		know the characteristics of the existing wavelength LSPs. The impairment information relating 
		to existing and to-be-established LSPs can be obtained by nodes in WSON networks via external 
		configuration or other means such as monitoring or estimation based on a vendor-specific 
		impair model. However, WSON related routing protocols, i.e.,  <xref target="I-D.ietf-ccamp-wson-signal-compatibility-ospf" />
		and  <xref target="I-D.ietf-ccamp-gmpls-general-constraints-ospf-te" />, 
		only advertise limited information (i.e., availability) of the existing wavelengths, 
		without defining the supported client bit rates. It will incur substantial amount of control 
		plane overhead if routing protocols are extended to support dissemination of the new 
		information relevant for the IA-RWA process. In this scenario, stateful PCE(s) would be a more 
		appropriate mechanism to solve this problem. Stateful PCE(s) can exploit impairment 
		information of LSPs stored in LSP-DB to provide accurate RWA calculation. </t>
