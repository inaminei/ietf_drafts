    <abstract>
		<t> A stateful Path Computation Element (PCE) has access to not only the
		information disseminated by the network's Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP), but also 
		the set of active paths and their reserved resources for its computation.  
		The additional LSP state information allows	the PCE to compute constrained
        paths while considering individual LSPs and their interactions.
        This requires a reliable state synchronization mechanism between the
        PCE and the network, PCE and path computation clients (PCCs), and between cooperating PCEs. 
        The basic mechanism for state synchronization is part of the stateful PCE specification. 
        This draft presents motivations for optimizations to the base state synchronization procedure
		and specifies the required PCE protocol extensions.</t>

    <section anchor="sync-avoidance" title="State Synchronization Avoidance">
      
	  <section anchor="sync-avoidance-motivation" title="Motivation"> 
	  
	    <t>The purpose of state synchronization is to provide a
        checkpoint-in-time state replica of a PCC's LSP state in a stateful PCE. State
        synchronization is performed immediately after the initialization phase
        (<xref target="RFC5440"/>). <xref target='I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce'></xref> describes 
		the basic mechanism for state synchronization.</t>

        <t> State synchronization is not always necessary following a PCEP session restart. If the 
        state of both PCEP peers did not change, the synchronization phase may be skipped. This 
        can result in significant savings in both control-plane data exchanged and the time it 
		takes for the stateful PCE to become fully operational. </t> 	
	  
	  </section> <!-- sync-avoidance-motivation -->
	  	 
	 <section anchor="sync-avoidance-procedures" title="State Synchronization Avoidance Procedure">
         	 
          <t>State synchronization MAY be skipped following a PCEP session
          restart if the state of both PCEP peers did not change during the
          period prior to session re-initialization.  To be able to make this
          determination, state must be exchanged and maintained by both PCE and
          PCC during normal operation.  This is accomplished by keeping track of
          the changes to the LSP state database, using a version tracking field called
          the LSP State Database Version Number.</t>
          
          <t> The LSP State Database Version Number, carried in LSP-DB-VERSION TLV
		  (see <xref target="DB-VERSION-TLV"/>), is owned by a PCC and it MUST be incremented 
		  by 1 for each successive change in the PCC's LSP state database.  The LSP State 
		  Database Version Number MUST start at 1 and may wrap around. Values 0 and 
		  0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF are reserved.  Operations that trigger a change to the local 
		  LSP state database include a change in the LSP operational state, delegation of an LSP,
          removal or setup of an LSP or change in any of the LSP attributes
          that would trigger a report to the PCE. </t>

          <t>State aynchronization avoidance is advertised on a PCEP session
          during session startup using the INCLUDE-DB-VERSION (IDB) bit in the
          capabilities TLV (see <xref target="Capability-TLV"/>). The peer may
          move in the network, either physically or logically, which may cause
          its connectivity details and transport-level identity (such as IP
          address) to change. To ensure that a PCEP peer can recognize a
          previously connected peer even in face of such mobility, each PCEP
          peer includes the SPEAKER-ENTITY-ID TLV described in 
          <xref target="SPEAKER-ENTITY-ID-TLV-OPEN"/> in the OPEN message.</t>

          <t>If both PCEP speakers set the IDB flag in the OPEN
          object's STATEFUL-PCE-CAPABILITY TLV to 1, the PCC will include the
          LSP-DB-VERSION TLV in each LSP object of the PCRpt message. If the LSP-DB-VERSION 
		  TLV is missing in a PCRpt message, the PCE will generate an error with error-type 6 
		  (mandatory object missing) and Error Value 12 (LSP-DB-VERSION TLV missing) and 
		  close the session.  If state synchronization avoidance has not been enabled 
		  on a PCEP session, the PCC SHOULD NOT include the LSP-DB-VERSION TLV in 
		  the LSP Object and the PCE SHOULD ignore it were it to receive one. </t>

		  <t>If a PCE's LSP state database survived the restart of a PCEP
          session, the PCE will include the LSP-DB-VERSION TLV in its OPEN
          object, and the TLV will contain the last LSP State Database Version Number
          received on an LSP State Report from the PCC in the previous PCEP
          session. If a PCC's LSP State Database survived the restart of a PCEP
          session, the PCC will include the LSP-DB-VERSION TLV in its OPEN object 
          and the TLV will contain the latest LSP State Database Version Number  
          it sent on an LSP State Report in the previous PCEP session.  
          If a PCEP speaker's LSP state database did not survive the restart of 
          a PCEP session, the PCEP speaker MUST NOT include the LSP-DB-VERSION 
          TLV in the OPEN object.</t>
		 
          <t>If both PCEP speakers include the LSP-DB-VERSION TLV in the OPEN
          Object and the TLV values match, the PCC MAY skip state
          synchronization.  Otherwise, the PCC MUST perform state
          synchronization to the stateful PCE.  If the PCC attempts to skip state synchronization
          (i.e., the SYNC Flag = 0 on the first LSP State Report from the PCC),
          the PCE MUST send back a PCError with Error-type 20 Error-value 2 'LSP
          Database version mismatch', and close the PCEP session. </t>
	  
		  <t>If state synchronization is required, then prior to completing the
          initialization phase, the PCE MUST mark any LSPs in the LSP database
          that were previously reported by the PCC as stale.  When the PCC
          reports an LSP during state synchronization, if the LSP already exists
          in the LSP database, the PCE MUST update the LSP database and clear
          the stale marker from the LSP.  When it has finished state
          synchronization, the PCC MUST immediately send an end of synchronization
          marker. The end of synchronization marker is a Path Computation State Report (PCRpt) message
		  with an LSP object containing a PLSP-ID of 0 and with the SYNC flag set to 0
          (<xref target='I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce'></xref>). The LSP-DB-VERSION TLV 
          MUST be included in this PCRpt message.  On receiving this state report, the PCE MUST
		  purge any LSPs from the LSP database that are still marked as stale.</t>

          <t>Note that a PCE/PCC MAY force state synchronization by not including
          the LSP-DB-VERSION TLV in its OPEN object.</t>
		  
		  <t>Since a PCE does not make changes to the LSP State Database Version Number,
		  a PCC should never encounter this TLV in a message from the PCE (other than the OPEN message).
		  A PCC SHOULD ignore the LSP-DB-VERSION TLV, were it to receive one from a PCE. </t>
		  
		  <t>If state synchronization avoidance is enabled, a PCC MUST increment
          its LSP State Database Version Number when the 'Redelegation Timeout
          Interval' timer expires (see <xref target='I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce'></xref>) 
		  for the use of the Redelegation Timeout Interval). </t>

          sequence where the state synchronization is skipped. </t>

	<t>Assuming there are 320 LSPs in the network, with each PCC having 80 
   LSPs.  During the time when the PCEP session is down, 20 LSPs of each 
   PCC (i.e., 80 LSPs in total), are changed. Hence when PCEP session 
   restarts, the stateful PCE needs to synchronize 320 LSPs with all 
   PCCs.  But actually, 240 LSPs stay the same.  If performing full LSP 
   state synchronization, it can take a long time to carry out the 
   synchronization of all LSPs.  It is especially true when only a low 
   bandwidth communication channel is available and there is a 
   substantial number of LSPs in the network.  Another disadvantage of 
   full LSP synchronization is that it is a waste of communication 
   bandwidth to perform full LSP synchronization given the fact that 
   the number of LSP changes can be small during the time when PCEP 
   session is down. </t>
   
   <t>An incremental (Delta) LSP Database (LSP-DB) state synchronization 
   is described in this section, where only the LSPs underwent state 
   change are synchronized between the session restart. This may 
   include new/modified/deleted LSPs. Furthermore, to avoid overloading

   <t>If both PCEP speakers include the LSP-DB-VERSION TLV in the OPEN

   when D flag is set to 1 by both PCC and PCE (see <xref target="Capability-TLV"/>).  
   Other combinations of D flag setting by PCC and PCE result in full LSP-DB synchronization 
   procedure as described in <xref target='I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce'></xref>. If a PCC has

   configured at the PCC; (2) no sufficient LSP state caches for incremental update, the

	<t>A stateful PCE MAY choose to control the LSP-DB synchronization 
   process. To allow PCE to do so, PCEP speakers MUST set T bit to 1 to indicate 
   this as described in <xref target="triggered-sync"/>.  If the LSP-DB Version 
   is mis-matched, it can send a PCUpd message with PLSP-ID = 0 and S = 1 
   in order to trigger the LSP-DB synchronization process.  In this way, the PCE can 
   control the sequence of LSP synchronization among all the PCCs that re-
   establishing PCEP sessions with it.  When the capability of PCE 
   control is enabled, only after a PCC receives this message, it will 
   then start sending information that PCE does not possess, which is
   inferred from the LSP-DB version information exchanged in the OPEN 
   message.  Note that the PCE should not mark the existing LSPs as stale for 
   incremental state synchronisation procedure.</t> 
   
   <t>As per <xref target="sync-avoidance"/>, the LSP State Database Version Number is 
   incremented each time a change is made to the PCC's local LSP State 
   Database. Each LSP is associated with the DB version at the time of 
   its state change.  This is needed to determine which LSP and what 
   information needs to be synchronized in incremental state 
   synchronization. </t>
   
   <t>It is not necessary for a PCC to store a complete history of LSP Database
   change, but rather remember the LSP state change, including LSP 
   modification, setup and deletion, that happend between the PCEP sessions in order to carry out
   incremental state synchronization. After the synchronization procedure finishes, 
   the PCC can dump this history information. In the example shown in <xref target="fig_inc"/>, the PCC 
   needs to store the LSP state change happend between DB Version 43 to 46 and synchronizes 
   these changes only when performing incremental LSP state update. </t>
   
   <t> If a PCC finds out it does not have sufficient information after advertising
   incremental LSP state synchronization capability, it MUST send a PCErr with error-type 20
   and error-value 5(see <xref target="PCEP-Error-Object"/>).</t>
