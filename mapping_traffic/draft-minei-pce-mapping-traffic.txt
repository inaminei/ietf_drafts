           Enabling Stateful PCE to Tag Label Switched Paths
                    draft-minei-pce-traffic-mapping

Abstract

   An active stateful PCE can change characteristics of label switched
   paths (LSPs), or even initiate the creation of LSPs.  How these LSPs
   are used for forwarding traffic has been considered a topic outside
   of PCEP's scope.  Regardless of how such a mapping is implemented, it
   requires the ability to identfiy the LSP or LSPs to use for
   forwarding in a flexible way.  This document proposes an extension to
   PCEP to allow tagging LSPs for the purpose of traffic mapping.

1.  Introduction

   [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce] specifies the PCEP extensions in support
   of active stateful PCEs.  A PCC can delegate its LSPs to the PCE,
   allowing the PCE to update various attributes (such as path or
   bandwidth) [I-D.crabbe-pce-pce-initiated-lsp] specifies a mechanism
   allowing a PCE to dynamically instantiate LSPs on a PCC by sending
   the path and characteristics of the LSP.  In both cases, the PCE
   takes an active role, initiating changes in the network without the
   PCC initiating this interaction.  This model makes an active stateful
   PCE a very attractive building block for SDN solutions.

   When integrating a stateful PCE in a larger solution, the mapping of
   traffic to the LSPs is an important function.  Two decisions must be
   taken to allow for such a mapping: 1) which traffic should be mapped
   (forwarding equivalence class identification), for example "map all
   traffic with destination port xxx" and 2) which is the LSP onto which
   the traffic should be forwarded (LSP identification), for example
   "LSP to destination yyy, with latency guarantee x".  Note that: a)
   multiple forwarding equivalence classes (FECs) may be mapped to the
   same LSP, b) one FEC may be mapped to one or more LSPs and c) the
   mapping should be communicated in a way that allows both PCE-
   controlled and non-PCE-controlled LSPs to be used, and allows both a
   central and a distributed mode of operation, so as to allow
   deployment of this function in a mixed network.

   Similar to how a route may be associated with one or more communities
   in BGP, an LSP may be tagged with one or more opaque LSP-tags to
   allow for easy LSP identification.  This association may be 1)
   configured on the router or 2) communicated by an active stateful PCE
   or 3) distributed in a dynamic way (outside the scope of this
   document).  This draft defines the procedures for associating an LSP-
   tag to an LSP in PCEP.


2.  Terminology

   The following terminologies are used in this document:

   LSR:  Label Switching Router.

   PCC:  Path Computation Client.

   PCE:  Path Computation Element

3.  LSP TAG TLV

   The LSP TAG represents an opaque valure to be associated with an LSP.
   The same LSP TAG may be associated with several LSPs by sending the
   LSP-TAG in a PCUpd message for each of them.  One LSP may be
   associated with multiple LSP TAGs by specifying them in separate
   TLVs.  The operator may define the opaque tag in any way that is
   convenient operationally, for example he may choose to embed the LSP
   destination address in the LSP TAG.  The tags associated with an LSP
   may change during the lifetime of the LSP (for example, if a tag
   represents compliance to a latency bound, when the LSP is rerouted
   along a non-compliant path, the tag would need to be removed to avoid
   mapping delay-sensitive traffic to it).

                           Figure 1: LSP TAG TLV

   The LSP-TAG TLV is an optional TLV for use in the LSP Object
   ([I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce]).  Its format is shown in the above
   figure.  The type of the TLV is to be defined by IANA.  The flags
   field defines a single flag, the dis-association flag.

   o  D = 1:Dis-associate the tag specified in the TLV from the LSP
      specified in the LSP object.

   On PCUpd, the D flag MAY be set by the PCE to request a dis-
   association of a tag it previously set.  XXX TBD - the error
   condition needs to be specified for the case where the disassociation
   is invalid.  In a PCRpt message, the PCC MUST report all the tags
   associated with an LSP.  If a TAG is missing it is considered removed
   (this is to support reporting associations communicated via different
   mechanisms, for example configuration, as well as associations
   established by the PCE).

   XXX TBD - add text on non-support.  Can either do capability
   negotiation or just ignore the unknown TLV.

4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to allocate a new TLV type (recommended value is
   TBD)for LSP-TAG TLV specified in this document.

   This document requests that a registry is created to manage the value
   of the Flag Type field in the LSP-TAG TLV.  XXX TBD the flag values

   XXX TBD - document errors
